# Personal_Learnings

This repo serves as a hub for some of my personal learning resources/projects in data science and machine learning, which I am compiling from various platforms including LinkedIn Learn, Coursera, and YouTube tutorials.

My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge and practical skills through self-directed learning to tackle real-world problems effectively.
